# Brute-Force
In this repository I took the opputrunity to create some programs that are based on a common attack known as brute force. In one of my electrial engineering classes
I was task to solve for capacitor and resistor values for a given circuit. I along with another student decided to approach this method by creating a brute force program
to solve for not only a pair of values but all the values. This was a fun exercice because we decided to explore different programming languages and were also testing a common
cybersecurity attack in a control enviorement. I decided to use this approach to solve for resistor values in some of my personal projects.

The programs were written by Alexander Hanks and Luke Henderson
THIS IS FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES ONLY!
